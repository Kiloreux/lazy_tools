# Lazy Tools #

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a bunch of tools that I have developed due to my super laziness on working with the linux OS, if you think you have an idea for a tool really lazy, open an issue, and I'd be happy to develop the laziest tool every time.

## Usage ##

`envthis VARIABLE_NAME # adds the current path under VARIABLE_NAME`

`paththis # adds the current path to the $PATH variable`

`shortenthis https://www.google.com # shortens the URL and give it back to you`

##Compiling###

You should know that, I'm too lazy to tell you.
